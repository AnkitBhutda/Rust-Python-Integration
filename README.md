# Rust-Python-Integration
Rust-Python Integration Project This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Rust and Python by creating a bridge between the two languages. It allows you to call Rust functions from Python and vice versa, enabling you to leverage the performance of Rust while still benefiting from the flexibility and ease of use of Python.
